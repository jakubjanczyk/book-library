# Books library

This projects aims to create a book library. Users can add, remove and edit books. 
Displayed books can be sorted by different conditions and they can be filtered down to selected category.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

There's `json-server` starting up in the background that contains some example books to display. 
Any books added, removed or changed would be reset to default after restarting script.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
